======

Monterey kde is a MacOS Monterey like theme for KDE Plasma desktop.

Currently Monterey Dark by vince Liuice available for download in KDE is not working properly as it is not up to date, when the problem is fixed I will remove this one, the intention is just to facilitate the installation without the need to correct the problem every time I install.

In this repository you'll find:

- Aurorae Theme
- Kvantum Theme
- Wallpaper Theme
- Plasma Color Scheme
- Plasma Desktop Theme
- Plasma Global Theme

## Installation

```sh
./install.sh
```

## Recommendations

- For better looking please use this pack with [Kvantum engine](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/blob/master/Kvantum/INSTALL.md#distributions).

  Run `kvantummanager` to choose and apply **Monterey** (or any other Monterey) theme.

- Install [WhiteSur icon theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-icon-theme) for a more consistent and beautiful experience.

- Install [WhiteSur cursors theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-cursors) for a more consistent and beautiful experience.
